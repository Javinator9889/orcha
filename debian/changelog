python3-orcha (0.1.10) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Improve watchdog mechanism by leveraging the handling to the internal
    processor, the same that handles all the petitions (and which could fail
    due to a deadlock or being blocked or any queue mechanism not working as
    expected).

python3-orcha (0.1.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Processor class is now more resilient and handles unexpected exceptions by
    notifying SystemD about our status more frequently. If an unexpected error
    happens (and we are a SystemD service), the watchdog will be triggered and
    we expect to be restarted.
  * Petition objects now implement both equality and comparison operators. We
    relied on dataclasses for such purpose but we've seen some exceptions that
    are happening when an EmptyPetition (for notifying that we have finished) is
    enqueued. Looks like dataclass' __eq__ and __lt__ operators require both
    objects to be exactly the same class, and it does not support subclasses.
