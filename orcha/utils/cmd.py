    """
    Runs a command in a "secure" environment redirecting stderr into stdout and
    calling :func:`on_output` on every line (as they are being written).

    The method accepts three functions which are used for defining a custom behavior
    during execution:

        + :func:`on_start` receives the :class:`Popen <subprocess.Popen>` object just
          created, even before starting running something.
        + :func:`on_output` receives a UTF-8 string corresponding with current command output.
        + :func:`on_finish` receives the program return code, so you can handle any errors
          that may occur.

    Args:
        cmd (:obj:`str` | :class:`Collection <collections.abc.Collection>`): the command to run.
            Can be a :obj:`str` or an iterable. If a :obj:`str` is given
            then :func:`shlex.split` is called for dividing the command.
        on_start (Callable[[subprocess.Popen], Any]): function to be run when the process has
            just started. Defaults to :obj:`None`.
        on_output (Callable[[str], Any]): function to be called when the process outputs a line.
            Defaults to :obj:`None`.
        on_finish (Callable[[int], Any]): function to be called when the process finishes.
            Defaults to :obj:`None`.
        cwd (str): working directory to move on when calling the command. Defaults to :obj:`None`.
